Among the elephants is one that lost a foot when it stepped on a Land Mine. Another is blind and totally reliant on humans. The elephant herd in Pinnawela makes the journey to the river twice a day to bathe under the eyes of the tourists. The sound of cameras clicking increases every time one of the young elephant babies splashes about in the water.&nbsp;<br />After spending some memorable time with the elephants, you will proceed to Sigiriya, where you will spend the next 2 nights at Vil Uyana; a luxury boutique created with the theme of a typical Lankan Village in mind.&nbsp;<br />The journey from the main road to the hotel is guaranteed to be memorable where an exclusive bullock cart will take you along the beaten track with Sri Lankan hospitality in the form of &lsquo;Thambili&rsquo; (king coconut) &amp; cold towels.

Built during the 11th and 12th Centuries AD, it is one of the best preserved cities in Sri Lanka. interesting sites to visit are the Royal Palace, the spectacular Gal Viharaya complex where wonderful statues of Lord Buddha in different postures can be seen. Many of the existing ruins owe their construction to Parakramabahu the Great, the last in a sequence of warrior-kings, who developed the city on a lavish scale.
